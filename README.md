🌟 *E-Commerce System* 🌟

🎯 *Description*  
This is a simple e-commerce system implemented in C++. The system allows customers to create orders containing multiple products, process payments via credit card, and save order details to a file. The code demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

✨ *Features*  
- 🛒 *Product Management*: Create and manage products with attributes like name, price, and quantity.
- 👤 *Customer Management*: Create customers with names and email addresses.
- 📦 *Order Management*: Create orders for customers that can include multiple products.
- 💳 *Payment Processing*: Simulate credit card payment processing.
- 💾 *File I/O*: Save order details to a text file.

🔧 *Requirements*  
- C++11 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations

📥 *Installation*  
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce system.git
